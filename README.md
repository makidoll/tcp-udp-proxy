# TCP-UDP-Proxy

Use with Docker Compose like this:

```yml
services:
    tcp-udp-proxy:
        image: ghcr.io/makidoll/tc-udp-proxy:latest
        restart: always
        environment:
            PROXY_CONF: |
                #ip bandwidth limit format: ip SEND_BANDWIDTH(B/s) RECV_BANDWIDTH(B/s)
                #example: ip 100000 100000
                #tcp proxy format: tcp SRC_PORT DST_IP DST_PORT [MAX_BANDWIDTH(B/s)] [DELAY_MS(ms)]
                #example tcp 3443 180.166.47.38 3443
                #udp proxy format: udp SRC_PORT DST_IP DST_PORT [MAX_BANDWIDTH(B/s)] [DELAY_MS(ms)] [DROP_PROB(0.01%, that is 100 = 1%, 10000 = 100%)]
                #example: udp 6500 10.35.60.1 6500 100000 100 1000
```

## Original README

A proxy server program written in C++ that can forward TCP or UDP packets to and from some pre-configured address. It's a transparent proxy in that remote clients only have to change their destination IP/PORT into those of the proxy, and the proxy will automatically forword packets according to pre-configured rules.

A typical usage scenario is to bypass a company firewall that blocks packets from some limited internal IP/Subnets.

It can also be used for simulating public network environment in an intranet by configuring bandwidth limit, network delay, or packet drop rate(only for UDP).

[Install]
Boost Library is required. Please look into src/Makefile to find out how Boost libs are linked, and you can change the path according to your environment.

On Linux:
$cd src
$make

On Windows:
Becasue the project is cross-platform, it can be compiled as a Visual Studio C++ project. What you have to do is to create a project and import all files under src dir, also remember to link those Boost libs listed in Makefile.

[Configuration and Usage]
Refer to the comments in proxy.conf to see how to configure the forwarding rules.
A typical proxy.conf looks like:

```
tcp 3443 180.166.47.38 3443
tcp 1234 180.166.47.38 1234 100000
udp 6500 10.35.60.1 6500 100000 100 1000
```

The 1st line shows the proxy will open local tcp port 3443 to receive new connections which are to be forwarded directly to and from remote address 180.166.47.38/3443.

The 2nd line does similar functions, the difference is it also imposes a bandwidth limit of 100K/S in both directions.

The 3rd line is a rule to forward UDP packets, from local port 6500 to remote address 10.35.60.1/6500, and also in reverse direction. Additionally, it indicates a bandwidth limit of 100K/S, a delay of 100ms, and a packet drop rate of 10%, in both directions.
